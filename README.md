# 🐸 Polywog

Polywog is across-platform framework for creating 2D games in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)
programming language. It contains everything you need to start making a game with no hassle, and
then gets out of your way. The rest is up to you!

## ✅ Features

Polywog is a pure-code framework that programmers can use to code their games in or even use build
their own game engines. It provides:

- 🖥️ a window, game loop, and rendering context out of the box and ready to go
- 🎮 mouse, keyboard, and gamepad input as well as virtual input mapping
- 🖼️ shaders, surfaces, textures, and other graphics resources
- 🖌️ a straightforward but powerful canvas-style drawing API
- 🧮 various math types for vectors, matrices, rotations, etc.
- 📐 geometry types for various shapes, overlap testing, extraction, raycasting, etc. 
- 🎨 tools for working with colors, image encoding, decoding, and manipulation
- 🧳 texture packing and other techniques for rendering optimization
- 🦀 and of course, full access to Rust's speed, power, ecosystem, and pleasure of use

### 🧱 Just the basics

The feature cutoff for Polywog is is very intentional, it is meant to isolate the ecosystem as a 2D
game development environment, but does not want to be too opinionated about what you are coding or
how you code it.

It is *just* low level enough that you could build a game directly on top of this, or an engine,
apps/tools to aid in development.

### 🌐 Cross platform

It is also designed to be a protective layer between you and cross-platform concerns such as
rendering, operating systems, input devices, or anything else that you want to *Just Work* and not
think about. If the core Rust libraries it is built on support a platform, so should Polywog.

At the current time, Windows, macOS, and Linux are priority targets. Eventually, the goal is for
the framework to make its way onto game consoles as well.

### 👩‍🎓 Create while you learn

Finally, Polywog aims to be a fun way to learn the language while also getting to do something
creative with it. It comes with a growing suite of examples and templates to make getting new
prototypes up and running quick and painless, so you can get right to coding the fun part.

We want users to meet Rust in a way that softens a lot of its restrictions that often frighten off
new users, but allow them access to its power when they become more comfortable with it.

Making games and prototypes is a cool way to learn a programming language, we think.

## 🤔 Is this for me?

### 👍 Polywog may be for you if you...
- want to make weird and cool 2D indie games and prototypes
- are interested in learning Rust in a playful, creative way
- want a backend to build your own 2D engine on top of

### 👎 Polywog is not for you if you...
- want a game engine with an editor and all the bells & whistles
- want to make a 3D or big AAA game with a huge team and make zillions of bucks
- want to make mobile or web games (not impossible, I just have no interest in supporting it)

### 🔍 Want an alternative?

You can think Polywog as akin to frameworks like [Love2D](https://www.love2d.org/),
[MonoGame](https://monogame.net/), [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/), or
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). If you want a framework like this but in another language,
we recommend checking out those great projects.

If you want to stick with Rust but want a more opinionated but also more substantial project with
a larger community, definitely check out [Bevy](https://bevy.org/)! They're cool folks making
something very ambitious.
